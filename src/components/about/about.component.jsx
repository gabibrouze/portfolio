			I am enrolled as a student of Computer Science at Goldsmiths, University
			of London. In pursuing my degree on a virtual platform, my work ethic,
			discipline and communication skills have been highlighted, and reinforced
			by positive feedback and the desire to learn and develop.

			Before making the decision to change trajectories, careerwise, my prior
			studies in Business, Accounting and Law, instilled not only invaluable
			knowledge in their respective fields, but also sparked my interest in
			Programming and Web Development. This hobby has grown to be my primary
			focus and passion.
